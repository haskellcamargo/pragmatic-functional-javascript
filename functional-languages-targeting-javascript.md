## Functional languages targeting JavaScript

If you are still not convinced about using JavaScript as a functional language, but enjoys the environment it provides and/or needs to do web or server development with it, then there are several alternative languages that encourages functional programming better than JavaScript and compile to it. You may think, if it compiles to JavaScript, why not writing JavaScript? Because languages provide abstractions to make problem solving easier. This would be the same thing about arguing about writing Assembly because "languages compile to it". There are almost as many languages that compile to JavaScript as there are JavaScript frameworks and libraries.
