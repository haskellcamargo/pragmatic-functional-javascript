## LiveScript

CoffeeScript is for Ruby as LiveScript is for Haskell. LiveScript is a functional language with strong roots on Haskell and F\# with dynamic type checking that compiles to pure and mappable JavaScript. It's very useful for prototyping and data transformation. It provides a standard library called `prelude-ls` with lots of functions to handle lists, objects and other data structures with focus on composition and immutability, but still allows everything that JavaScript does, such as loops and random effects \(not that you should use them\). LiveScript is a fork of Coco language, an indirect dialect of CoffeeScript, but it is a lot more expressive. It also provides source-maps to allow debugging on VSCode, Chrome or Firefox without headache or suffering.
