# Types

JavaScript by default doesn't provide support for static type or even runtime type checking. By having type coercion, all the syntactic valid programs are accepted and type errors will only be caught in runtime. For the sake of sanity, there are good tools we can use to make JavaScript code safer and identify most of the runtime errors of a program before they happen, I mean at compile time, like Flow or even TypeScript, the JavaScript superset.
